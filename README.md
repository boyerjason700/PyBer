# Overview of Analysis
Perform an exploratory analysis using data from PyBer, a python based rideshare app company.  Creating visualizations that showcase the relationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders, and percentages of drivers, riders, and fares for each city type.  Use both the analysis and visualizations to help PyBer make decisions regarding access to ridesharing services and affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# Results
## Overall 
### Urban leads in Total Fares but produces lowest averages

- Using the city type as our main reference, we can tell from the data that even with lower average fares per ride and per driver, the Urban type generates the highest number of Total Fares due to the number of drivers available. Rural city types have a lower supply of drivers which allows for an increase in fare pricing; thus, increasing per ride and driver averages.
- Takeaway from this DataFrame- 
    - *Oversupply of drivers increases availability for more rides, generating increased total fares.*
    - *Undersupply of drivers increases per ride and driver average fare pricing*

## Week by Week
### Holidays or Promotional?

- When we view the data from a timeframe standpoint, we can clearly see similar peaks in all three city types corelating with each other, indicating an increase in fares.  
    - *We cannot determine from this chart what exactly those peaks were due to; major event, holiday, promotional items.*  
- Both Urban and Suburban cities show an upwards trend through these four months leading into summer months with Rural cities showing almost a flat trend for the same time frame. 
- Takeaway from this Chart- 
    - *Circumstances surrounding major uptrend at end of February should be investigated and possibly reproduced to increase fares brought in.*

# Summary
Based off the data available and the results produced, the following items are recommended:
1. Balance number of drivers in all three city types to meet demand but not over supply the area.
2. Investigate sources of increased fare activity per city type to find repeatable causes and leverage to increase profits.
3. Perform second analysis using ride distance to determine how much of a factor it plays in overall fare profits.
